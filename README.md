# Good Burger

Restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour it!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Once there, the user has the option to "Throw Away" (delete) the devoured burger.

The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

Made with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. Follows the MVC design pattern; Uses Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate HTML.
